At the start of 2023, I embraced a career shift from tech writing to Ux design, a transition inspired by my deep interest in the field. My journey features transformative UX design internships with companies that have contributed significantly to honing my Ul and UX skills.
As a former tech writer, my unique perspective enriches my work as a UX designer. I blend the art of communication with the science of design to create user-centric solutions.
My design process seamlessly merges User Experience with a sleek and intuitive User Interface, delivering innovative solutions while ensuring easy user interactions.
When I'm not designing, you can find me curled up with a good fiction book or watching a particularly riveting psychological thriller.
I'm based in Lagos, Nigeria, but I have been working remotely with brands and businesses around the world since 2019.</p>
